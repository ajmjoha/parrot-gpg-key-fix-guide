üöÄ A complete guide to fix the frustrating `NO_PUBKEY 7A8286AF0E81EE4A` error in Parrot OS using **modern GPG practices**.

---

## üìå Introduction

`NO_PUBKEY` error prevents your system from verifying repository packages, and stops you from updating or installing anything safely. But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî this guide will walk you through the complete and modern fix to solve this problem and keep your system secure and up-to-date.

---

## üî• The Error

```bash
W: GPG error: https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot lory InRelease: NO_PUBKEY 7A8286AF0E81EE4A
```

This often occurs after:
- A **fresh install**
- A **new repository** being added
- **Expired or replaced** GPG keys
- An **incomplete upgrade**

---

## üß™ The Problem in Action

When you run `sudo apt update`, you‚Äôll see output like:

```bash
W: GPG error: https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot lory InRelease: The following signatures couldn‚Äôt be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 7A8286AF0E81EE4A
E: The repository 'https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot lory InRelease' is not signed.
```

This means APT refused to proceed because it cannot verify the source.

## ‚úÖ The Modern Fix (Recommended by APT in 2025)

We‚Äôll now fix the error **permanently** using the **trusted GPG keyring directory (`/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/`)**, instead of the legacy `apt-key` method.

### üîπ Step 1: Remove Any Broken or Corrupt Key

```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/parrot.gpg
```

### üîπ Step 2: Download and Install the Missing GPG Key

```bash
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 7A8286AF0E81EE4A
gpg --export 7A8286AF0E81EE4A | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/parrot.gpg
```

‚úÖ This downloads the key, exports it, and saves it in the correct binary format that APT accepts.

### üîπ Step 3: (Optional but Recommended) Remove the Legacy Key

```bash
sudo apt-key del 7A8286AF0E81EE4A 2>/dev/null
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/trusted.gpg
```

### üîπ Step 4: Update APT

```bash
sudo apt update
```

üéâ You should now see **no more GPG errors** and your system will fetch updates properly.

---

## üß™ Verify the Key (Optional)

```bash
gpg --show-keys /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/parrot.gpg
```

Expected output:

```
pub   rsa4096 2021-03-19 [SC] [expires: 2026-03-18]
      7A82 86AF 0E81 EE4A ...
uid           [ unknown] Parrot Security Archive Automatic Signing Key
```


## üí° Tips

Avoid using `apt-key` in 2025 and beyond. It's deprecated and insecure. Stick with `.gpg` keyring method.
